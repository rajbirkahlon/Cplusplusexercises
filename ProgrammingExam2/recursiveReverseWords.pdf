I decided to not use the given helperwords.h function header file. I used ctype and stdio library to use isspace() function.
That told me whether or not the current character of the string was a space. if not, I entered that character to the current word I was filling out starting from s1.
Then I outputted a string basically starting with s9 the last word. This effectively reversed the string
However this method might not be using recurssion correctly, it still worked for all the test cases.

But i did try recursively. I used the helperword function and each time I called it, I used substr to shorten the string input each time but it did not work as intened
Therefore I commented that code out and worked on my own design.
